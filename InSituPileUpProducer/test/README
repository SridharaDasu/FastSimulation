Try out this module to produce events with large pile up, generated
in-situ using Pythia8, using CMSSW FastSimulation program.  There is
no need for large pile up minbias samples ... I suggest using Pythia8
for hard event also, but you should be able to use any generator.

Instructions for checkout build and run a test:

  scram project CMSSW CMSSW_5_3_10_patch2
  cd CMSSW_5_3_10_patch2/src/
  cmsenv
  mkdir FastSimulation
  cd FastSimulation/
  cvs co -d  InSituPileUpProducer UserCode/dasu/InSituPileUpProducer
  cd InSituPileUpProducer/
  scram b
  cd test
  cmsRun InSituPileUpProducer_cfg.py >& PU140.log&

The test produced 100 Z->mu+mu- events with average PU = 140 at 5 Hz
on an AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 6176 (just an ordinary box :)
